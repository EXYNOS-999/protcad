protCAD official development tree

protCAD is an implementation of the protein design software library that originated in the Bill Degrado Lab and is currently maintained by The Vikas Nanda Lab https://sites.google.com/site/viknanda

Publications so far on protCAD's methods are:

-Computational Methods and their Applications for de novo Functional Protein Design and Memebrane Protein Solubilization, Summa CM Thesis 2002
-Empirical estimation of local dielectric constants: Toward atomistic design of collagen mimetic peptides, Biopolymers - Peptide Science. 2015; 104(4): 360-70.


 Installation
===========================

-Install dependencies

Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran git

Mac:

xcode-select --install 


-Download source and compile

git clone https://github.com/protCAD/protcad 

cd protcad

make install

source ~/.bashrc


 Usage
===========================

-General use programs are compiled via make install and the source is available in the projects directory.  Since make install also adds the bin directory to your path, programs in projects are immediately available to run in any directory.


 Development process
===========================

New programs need to be added to the Makefile in protcad/ for compilation, like programs in projects have been. Additional examples are in the protcad/src/tests folder for reference and can be added to the projects directory and MakeFile for compilation. New programs written are intended to follow the same directory structure and usage as in projects.

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The master branch is regularly built and tested.  Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of protCAD.

The dev branch is a more experimental version being developed.
